## Key Features

- **User Management**: Multiple user accounts with role-based access, login validation, account status management (active/inactive), password recovery, and security measures (3x attempt lockout)
- **Inventory Management**: Dashboard for monitoring stock levels, low-stock notifications, supplier management, and product categorization (barcode and non-barcode items)
- **Sales & Reporting**: Sales and profit tracking per month, transaction history, discount application, VAT/non-VAT handling, and detailed sales reports
- **POS Functionality**: Barcode scanning for fast transactions, daily start/end cash flow tracking, customer receipts, and user profile integration
- **Additional Tools**: Import/export data using Excel (CSV), barcode generator, product printing, and supplier module for procurement management

## Technologies Used

- **VB.NET**: Core application development
- **SQL Server**: Database management and transaction storage
- **Crystal Report**: Advanced sales and inventory reporting
- **Guna Framework**: Modern UI components for user-friendly design
- **Microsoft Excel**: Import/export functionality for data migration and reporting

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the challenges was ensuring data accuracy during high transaction volumes while keeping the system responsive. Implementing robust validation and error-handling mechanisms became crucial, especially for preventing duplicate entries and managing concurrent users. Designing a reporting module with Crystal Report also required attention to formatting and data integrity. Through these challenges, I learned the importance of balancing usability with reliability in business-critical applications

## Outcome

The Pharmacy POS and Inventory System successfully automated key pharmacy operations, reducing manual work and improving efficiency. It enabled real-time inventory monitoring, faster sales transactions, and reliable reporting, making it easier for pharmacy staff to manage daily operations. This project highlighted the value of integrating usability and functionality in business software solutions
