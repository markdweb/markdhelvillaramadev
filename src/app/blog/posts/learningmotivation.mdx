## Hello World

I am starting this site with a purpose - to perpetuate a meaning to my life, and to be a home for my mind.

## Learning

Software development is an amazing job, if continuous learning doesn't scare you.

But if you're like me, that is to say a crazy person always on the lookout for the latest technologies and innovations, then this is a job for you! I can't go a day without at least learning something, no matter what the subject.
