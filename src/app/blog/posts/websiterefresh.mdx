## My Website Journey

I used to treat my website like a sandbox. Every new idea got added—half-baked projects, random experiments, and scattered components. It was fun to try things out, but looking back, it didn’t really show who I am or what I care about.


## Why Focus Matters

Over time, I realized the clutter was distracting. Visitors didn’t see my work—they just saw noise. And honestly, I didn’t see it clearly myself. This refresh is about focus: highlighting projects I’m proud of, experiments I’m learning from, and occasional updates about my journey as a web developer.

## Balancing Fun and Purpose

That doesn’t mean I’ve stopped tinkering. I still explore new web technologies, try out UI trends, and experiment with different ideas—but that happens in separate spaces. This is where I keep the spotlight on what matters most: my work and growth. It feels cleaner, calmer, and more “me.”

Peace ✌️
